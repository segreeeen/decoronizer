DeCoronizer is a Chrome extension that socially distances you from the Puppy virus by fixing websites.

## Why?

We don't know why.

If you see any point in this extension, please let us know.

## Download

Install directly via Chrome Store:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/decoronizer/npckgaijeiinglceeagkddhnfbkhoeko

(https://github.com/segreeeen/decoronizer/archive/master.zip)

Install as a developer: https://github.com/segreeeen/decoronizer/wiki/(De)Installationsanleitung-Deutsch

## Usage

Once installed, you will have a new icon next to the address bar.

Select a flavour (Kitty, Dogs, Chuck etc.) by clicking on one of the images.

The icon in your browser will now change to a prohibitory sign, indicating that from now on,
(almost) all websites you visit, will be DeCoronized.

Confused? The green sign indicates an inactive plugin and the crossed sign an active?
Welcome to the world of DeCoronizer!

Anyway ... from now on, (almost) all websites will be DeCoronized (unfortunately only in your browser).
You are distanced from vitally important messages and a lot of information is distorted and messed up,
just for you. The plugin can put your life in danger if you believe the information - is there really
a Chuck Norris-virus? Or is it a Bunnyvirus? Who knows?

_BUT_

If you are a sensitive person who suffers from bad news more than normal people,
this extension will be your salvation.

_IS THIS ALL, DAVE? NO, JIM ...._

As a special bonus, Twitter becomes utterly useless for you.
This feature alone already makes this plugin worthwhile.
